## Details

The application is initiated by the toolchain [Create React App], which creates files and the application operating environment. The startup script [â€¦.\node_modules\react-scripts\scripts\start.js] starts a local web server, embeds the project files (html, css, js) and starts public/index.html along with the compiled tsx files.
